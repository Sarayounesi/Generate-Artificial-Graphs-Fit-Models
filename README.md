This repository contains solutions for Assignment #3, which involves collecting network datasets, fitting various models, and analyzing the results- Spring, Dr.Rahmani-2023

Assignment #3 Tasks
1. 
Collect Three Networks
•  Download Two Networks: Search for network datasets, ensuring one has at least 1000 nodes.

•  Prepare One Network: Create a network of known nodes and edges (e.g., cities, people, software, web-pages) with at least 10 nodes. This network should be prepared manually.

•  References: Mention all sources and references used.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Fit Models to Networks
•  Fit the following models to the collected networks:

•  Erdős–Rényi (ER)

•  Watts–Strogatz (WS)

•  Barabási–Albert (BA)

•  Model X (best fitting model)

•  Generate artificial graphs similar to the real networks using the best fitting model.

•  Specify the suitable generative parameters for each model.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Compute Macro-level Metrics
•  Degree Distribution

•  Average Clustering Coefficient

•  Other relevant metrics

------------------------------------------------------------------
Compare and Analyze
•  Compare the features of the real and artificial graph counterparts.

•  Analyze the results and discuss any interesting findings or patterns.
